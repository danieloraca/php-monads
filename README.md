# PHP Monad Implementation

This project demonstrates a simple Monad implementation in PHP using a Result class. 

It encapsulates both success and error states, allowing safe chaining of operations without explicit error checking. 

The `Result` monad provides methods like `map()`, `getOrElse()`, and `isSuccess()` to handle operations and results in a functional style.

* Success Case: Encapsulates a value for further processing.

* Error Case: Propagates an error without breaking the chain of operations.

#Monads in Rust and Haskell
Monads are a powerful abstraction for managing side effects, chaining computations, and handling errors in a functional programming style.

#Haskell:
* Monads are core to Haskell and are used to handle effects like I/O, state, and errors without leaving pure functional programming. 

They provide a way to sequence operations while keeping code clean and composable.

* Common Haskell monads include `Maybe`, `Either`, and `IO`.

* Example: The Maybe monad helps avoid null reference errors, as it explicitly defines the presence (`Just`) or absence (`Nothing`) of a value.

#Rust:
* Rust uses monads through types like `Result` and `Option`, which are very similar to Haskell's `Either` and `Maybe`.

* Rustâ€™s monads allow for safe handling of errors and optional values, avoiding the common pitfalls of null pointers and unchecked errors.

* Rust encourages composition through monadic operations like `.map()`, `.and_then()`, and pattern matching, making error-handling elegant and type-safe.
