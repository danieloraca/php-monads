# PHP Monad Implementation

This project demonstrates a simple Monad implementation in PHP using a Result class. 

It encapsulates both success and error states, allowing safe chaining of operations without explicit error checking. 

The Result monad provides methods like map(), getOrElse(), and isSuccess() to handle operations and results in a functional style.

* Success Case: Encapsulates a value for further processing.

* Error Case: Propagates an error without breaking the chain of operations.
